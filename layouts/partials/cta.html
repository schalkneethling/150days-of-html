    <p>I hereby invite everyone to read, and <a
            href="https://github.com/schalkneethling/150days-of-html">provide
            feedback</a>, as
        I write the content for the
        150 Days of HTML book. The book will be made up of around 150 days or chapters
        detailing <em>all</em> the elements of the HTML standard. I read the specification
        so you, mostly, donâ€™t have to. The online version is rich and interactive with
        editable Codepen and Codesandbox embeds and will get better over time.</p>
    <p>I will soon also make the book available for download via a special ePUB format
        that allows the same interactivity as the web version if that is more your style.
    </p>
    <p>In the end the website will be the main way to access all of the content whether
        online or offline. I look forward to hear back from everyone and making the best
        reference for HTML out there. Thank you for taking your time to read the content
        and providing feedback.</p>
