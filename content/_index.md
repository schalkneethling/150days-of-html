## Journey through the elements of HTML

I read the [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), so you don‚Äôt have to. üòÅ I take what I learn and break it down into short chapters, which combine to make up the 150 days of HTML. So start your journey through the elements of the core, semantic language of the web today.
