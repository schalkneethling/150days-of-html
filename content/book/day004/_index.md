# Chapter 4 | The base element

As mentioned in chapter 3, in this chapter we are going to look at an HTML element you may have never heard of. The element under discussion is the `base` element.

{{< youtube id="y1H11wi0F-4" title="150DaysofHTML, Chapter 4, The base element" >}}

The `base` element is written as self-closing tag. This means that, while a lot of tags are written as follows:

```html
<title>My page title</title>
```

A self closing tag is written like this:

```html
<base href="https://150daysofhtml.com" />
```

The `base` element allows you to set a base URL for all links on the current page, set a base browsing context, or both, for all links on the page. ðŸ”—

Letâ€™s look at an example.

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining"
      >The Shining</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand">The Stand</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10614.Misery">Misery</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10592.Carrie">Carrie</a></li>
</ul>
```

All of those links share the same **base** URL. ðŸ¤” Using the `base` element, you can avoid repeating the base URL in every link tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>I got your base</title>
    <base href="https://www.goodreads.com/" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="book/show/11588.The_Shining">The Shining</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/149267.The_Stand">The Stand</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/10614.Misery">Misery</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/10592.Carrie">Carrie</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

> NOTE: If the HTML above was on a page that was hosted as part of the Goodreads website, you would not include the URL as part of the link and instead, opt for using relative URLs. In other words, instead of `https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining` you will do just `book/show/11588.The_Shining`

Now, you may also want those links to always open in a new tab. One option is to do:

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="book/show/11588.The_Shining" target="_blank">The Shining</a></li>
  <li><a href="book/show/149267.The_Stand" target="_blank">The Stand</a></li>
  <li><a href="book/show/10614.Misery" target="_blank">Misery</a></li>
  <li><a href="book/show/10592.Carrie" target="_blank">Carrie</a></li>
</ul>
```

As mentioned, there is a second attribute you can set on the `base` element, and that attribute is the `target` attribute. We can therefore avoid repeating `target`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>I got your base</title>
    <base href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="book/show/11588.The_Shining">The Shining</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/149267.The_Stand">The Stand</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/10614.Misery">Misery</a></li>
      <li><a href="book/show/10592.Carrie">Carrie</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

{{< iframe iframesrc="https://codepen.io/schalkneethling/embed/preview/988bf51720dea707f2e07ccba198b644?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" class="code-frame" title="The base element: href and target attribute" >}}

With the above in place, **all** links in the current page will use `https://www.googreads.com` as its base URL and all links will open in a new tab. Interesting right?

Thing is, it does mean that **all** "links" will have this behaviour. This means that not only are anchor tags are affected, but that it will affect _all_ elements with an `href` attribute set. For example:

```html
<base href="https://www.goodreads.com/" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/pink.css" media="screen" />
```

In the above scenario, the browser will attempt to load the stylesheet from the Goodreads website, which is probably not what you intended. Thankfully, the `base` element only affects elements below it in source order, so changing the above to the following will solve that problem:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/pink.css" media="screen" />
<base href="https://www.goodreads.com/" />
```

Remember that `_blank` is not the only possible value for the `target` attribute. One other value is `_top`. Using `_top` as the value of `target` might be useful as a means of [frame busting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framekiller) aka, prevent your site from being displayed in an `iframe`.

```html
<base target="_top" />
```

While this will not prevent the site from initially being loaded in an `iframe`, it _will_ cause clicks on any links in the page to bust out of the `iframe` by setting its browsing context to the topmost browsing context i.e. the browser window itself.

I will close this chapter with an example use case that might be a bit of a stretch. I am using a combination of the `base` element, a specific CSS `class` on certain elements, and some JavaScript. The result is something that could be useful in a web applications.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <base target="_blank" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>The HTML base element - Day 4 | 150 Days of HTML</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/pink.css" media="screen" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="native" href="add-book">Add Book</a></li>
      <li><a class="native" href="view">View Bookshelf</a></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3Olm2de">Misery</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3OlsCQM">Carrie</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      if (event.target.classList.contains("native")) {
        event.preventDefault();
        window.location = event.target.href;
      }
    });
  </script>
</html>
```

With the above, clicks on any link that has a `class` attribute with the value `native` will be intercepted by JavaScript and opened in the same tab/window. All other links will open in a new tab. One interesting aspect to note about the above is that, even when intercepted by JavaScript, the value of `event.target.href` will use the base `href` value defined on the `base` element, for example `https://www.goodreads.com/add-book`. So be careful ðŸ˜„

Some final notes. There must be no more than one `base` element per page. If there are multiple, all but the first will be ignored. As with `href`, all elements that have a `target` attribute set are affected by the value of the `target` attribute of the `base` element. This means that forms with a `target` will also be affected.

The URL parsing algorithm works as follows (from the W3C documentation):

```html
<base href="https://www.example.com/news/index.html" />
...
<a href="archives.html">archives</a>
<!-- The above URL will be https://www.example.com/news/archives.html -->

<a href="/blog/archives.html">archives</a>
<!-- The above URL will be https://www.example.com/blog/archives.html -->

<a href="./blog/archives.html">archives</a>
<!-- The above URL will be https://www.example.com/news/blog/archives.html -->

<a href="https://www.otherwebsite.com/blog/archives.html">archives</a>
<!-- The above URL will be https://www.otherwebsite.com/blog/archives.html -->
```

Knowing the above might well open up some additional use cases for this element. I am curious to know what use cases people come up with using the `base` element. If you stumble on or devise some interesting use case, let me know!
