        <h1>Day 1</h1>
        <p>Welcome to day 1 of your 150 day journey. If one has always thought of HTML as
            just
            some form elements, divs, spans, links and paragraph tags, it seems kinda
            crazy to
            imagine that a journey through the HTML landscape can take 150 days.</p>
        <p>As you will see throughout this journey though, there is a <strong>lot</strong>
            more to
            the HTML language than just those elements. To be honest though, a lot of
            these
            are
            variants on the same base element derived from attributes. This is especially
            true
            with form elements. With that being said, these attributes can be immensely
            powerful
            in open up an entire new world of possibilities once you are aware of them.
        </p>
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
            <strong>M</strong>arkup
            <strong>L</strong>anguage and has been at the core of <a
                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web'>the web</a> since its
            very
            inception in 1989. It forms the bases of all things on the web no matter how
            simple or
            how complex. Without HTML, there is no webpage or web application. HTML also
            provides
            the <a href='https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/'>semantic
                structure
                of
                our documents and applications</a> and this is where knowing the language
            really
            pays off. Semantic structure is also critical when it comes to the
            accessibility
            of
            your documents, a topic I will touch on throughout the 150 days.
        </p>
        <p>In order for this 150 day journey to not become overly taxing I will not dig
            into
            every
            possible nook and cranny of the language and its history. With that said, I
            will
            provide links to further reading as appropriate and encourage you to explore
            these
            as
            time permits.</p>
        <h2>html</h2>
        <p>Today&#39;s element is the <code>html</code> element.</p>
        <p>Wait? What about the <code>DOCTYPE</code> though? That is a good question. When
            I
            started writing this course I fully intended to start with the
            <code>doctype</code>
            element but, I remembered reading somewhere that it is not actually an HTML
            element. I
            did a bit of research and indeed found that to be true.
        </p>
        <p>While the <code>doctype</code> is the very first entry in our HTML documents,
            it is
            in
            fact not an HTML element. The sole purpose of the <code>doctype</code> entry
            is to
            ensure that the browser does not switch into what is commonly know as <a
                href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode'>quirks
                mode</a>, but instead, makes a best effort attempt at following the
            relevant
            specification.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I say, &quot;best effort attempt&quot;, as not all browsers have
                implemented
                <strong>all</strong> of the HTML standard. This is especially true of
                older
                browsers and so, these browsers will do their best to interpret the
                language
                and
                use a fallback where it does not understand the specific syntax.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The <code>doctype</code> is required for all HTML documents and takes the
            following
            form:</p>

        <pre><code class='language-html' lang='html'>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code></pre>

        <blockquote>
            <p>There is an <a
                    href='https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype'>extended
                    legacy form</a>, but the above is all that you will ever need to be
                concerned
                with.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now that the browser knows that what follows will be HTML, we start our
            document
            with
            our root element.</p>

        <pre>
<code class='language-html' lang='html'>&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>Being at the root of our document, there is one very important attribute we
            should
            always set on the <code>html</code> tag.</p>
        <h3>lang</h3>
        <p>The <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>html</code> element indicates the
            primary
            language the document is written in. It also assists speech synthesis tools in
            what
            pronunciations to use, and helps translation tools select the rules they
            should
            apply.
            This leads to better overall accessibility of your documents. It takes the
            following
            form:</p>

        <pre>
<code class='language-html' lang='html'>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>Should you not want your entire document to be localisable through translation
            tools,
            you can specify the <a
                href='https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-translate'><code>translate</code>
                property</a>, setting its value to <code>no</code> :</p>

        <pre>
<code class='language-html' lang='html'>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>This concludes day 1 of our journey. I hope you have learned something new and
            can
            put
            it to use in your work.</p>
        <p>In day 2, we will start to explore the document meta data elements that form
            part
            of an
            HTML document with the first element being the <code>head</code> element.</p>
