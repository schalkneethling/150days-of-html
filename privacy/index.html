            regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a

            and other
            sites we own and operate.</p>
        <h3>Information we collect</h3>
        <h4>Log data</h4>
        <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data
            provided by your web browser. This data is considered “non-identifying
            information”,
            as it does not personally identify you on its own. It may include your
            computer’s
            Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you
            visit,
            the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other
            details.</p>
        <h4>Personal information</h4>
        <p>We may ask for personal information, such as your email address. This data is
            considered “identifying information”, as it can personally identify you. We
            only
            request personal information relevant to providing you with a service, and
            only use it
            to help provide or improve this service.</p>
        <h4>How we collect information</h4>
        <p>We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and
            consent. We
            also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used. You are
            free to
            refuse our request for this information, with the understanding that we may be
            unable
            to provide you with some of your desired services without it.</p>
        <h4>Use of information</h4>
        <p>We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to
            understand
            who our visitors are, how they use our services, and how we may improve their
            experience of our website in future. We do not disclose the specifics of this
            information publicly, but may share aggregated and anonymized versions of this
            information, for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.</p>
        <h4>Data processing and storage</h4>
        <p>We only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide a
            service, or
            to improve our services in future. While we retain this data, we will protect
            it
            within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
            unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we
            advise
            that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and
            cannot
            guarantee absolute data security.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>We use “cookies” to collect information about you and your activity across our
            site. A
            cookie is a small piece of data that our website stores on your computer, and
            accesses
            each time you visit so we can understand how you use our site and serve you
            content
            based on preferences you have specified.</p>
        <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser
            to
            refuse cookies from our website, understanding that we may be unable to
            provide you
            with some of your desired services without them. This policy covers only the
            use of
            cookies between your computer and our website; it does not cover the use of
            cookies by
            any third-party services we use on our site.</p>
        <h4>Third-party access to information</h4>
        <p>We may use third-party services for our website and marketing activity. These

        <p>We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for data if we believe a
            request
            is too broad or unrelated to its stated purpose. However, we may cooperate if
            we
            believe the requested information is necessary and appropriate to comply with
            legal
            process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of the
            public
            and any person, to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe
            to be
            illegal, legally actionable, or unethical activity.</p>
        <p>We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We
            do not
            sell or rent your personal information to marketers or third parties.</p>
