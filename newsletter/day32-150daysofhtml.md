# Day 32 - Video killed the radio star

Welcome to day 32!

Today we look at two elements that really caused quite the revolution on the web when they were introduced. Before the introduction of the `video` and `audio` elements, the most common way these media types were delivered over the web was either through [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), or [Microsoftâ€™s Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight).

> While we will touch on video and audio codecs to some degree, a detailed discussion around these topics is beyond the scope of the 150 days of HTML. If you are curious about all of this, do see the related reading section at the end of the post.

## Common attributes acroos `video` and `audio`

The majority of the attributes used with the two element match in form and function and so it makes sense to discuss those first and then address those that are unique. To be honest, there are only four unique attributes and they all apply to the `video` element.

### `src`

Without this attribute set there really is nothing but a quiet user interface element that is not of much utility to anyone ðŸ™ƒ so, it makes sense to dig into this one first. As the name suggests, this sets the source of the `video` or `audio` element.

When it comes to video the three most commonly used and most widely supported formats are [MP4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14), [WebM - The video form of WebP](https://www.webmproject.org/), and [OGG](https://theora.org/). Letâ€™s look at a very basic example of the `video` element using the most common format, mp4:

```html
<video src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4"></video>
```

For audio the most commonly used formats are [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3), [OGG](https://theora.org/), and [Flac](https://xiph.org/flac/), with MP3 by far being the most common and well supported. The most basic usage of the `audio` element is as follows:

```html
<audio src="../assets/morning-birds-singing.mp3"></audio>
```

While the above could be a valid use case for these elements, without some JavaScript, the above will either render nothing or a static first frame of the video. Not useful at all. We can fix this with addition of a single attribute.

### `controls`

As mentioned above, the default rendering for the `audio` and `video` elements is very limited and requires some JavaScript to play either the video or audio tracks. Unless you are building a custom player though, you can enable all the basic interaction elements a user will need with a single attribute.

Using the examples from above, we will simply add the `controls` attribute.

```html
<video src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4" controls></video>

<audio src="../assets/morning-birds-singing.mp3" controls></audio>
```

And as easy as that, you now have user interface elements to control these media streams.

### `crossorigin`

We have encountered this attribute a few times already. There is nothing new here and so, if the media asset you are loading does not require you to specify a cross origin resource sharing(CORS) strategy, you can simply omit the attribute. If the media server does require CORS, the attribute accepts either [`anonymous` or `with-credentials` as valid values](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-settings-attribute). For example, if you load an asset and the server requires CORS with credentials:

```html
<video
  src="https://mediaplex.com/assets/villa-pool.mp4"
  controls
  crossorigin="with-credentials"
></video>
<!-- or for anonymous CORS requests -->
<audio
  src="https://mediaplex.com/assets/morning-birds-singing.mp3"
  controls
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></audio>
```

### `preload`

Again, an attribute we have encountered before but here, it comes in a different guise. It is still a hint to the browser with regards to how it should load the media asset, but the possible values or much more limited.

By default the browser will do what it deems to be the best for the user considering the current environment but, as the author of the content, you might have some knowledge ahead about how users are likely to interact with the media. In these cases, you can make use of this attribute to provide a hint to the browser as to the loading strategy you would recommend. The first option is `none`, which tells the browser that the media is included but, it is either unlikely that the majority of users will want to interact with it or, you simply want to avoid unnecessary traffic to the server.

The second option is `metadata`. If sepcified it provides a hint to the user agent that, while you do not see the media asset(s) as critical, it may be worthwhile to prefetch the media metadata(dimensions, track list, duration, etc), and perhaps even the first few frames or bytes of audio.

```html
<video src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4" controls preload="metadata"></video>

<audio
  src="../assets/morning-birds-singing.mp3"
  controls
  preload="none"
></audio>
```

> NOTE: Setting the attribute and specifying an empty string is valid and maps to the `auto` state which is the default behavior for user agents so, there really is no need for this.

### `autoplay`

This attribute is a bit problematic. Off the bat I am going to quote a very important note from the specification docs here:

> Authors are urged to use the autoplay attribute rather than using script to trigger automatic playback, as this allows the user to override the automatic playback when it is not desired, e.g. when using a screen reader. Authors are also encouraged to consider not using the automatic playback behavior at all, and instead to let the user agent wait for the user to start playback explicitly.

[The above in its original context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-media-autoplay)

A use case where this could be used is for video backgrounds which you might have seen on websites such as PayPal. Even then it would need to be done responsibly by ensuring the video does not cause flickering, does not overly distract the user and, provide a way for users to easily disable autoplay by default. Also, this is a hint to the user agent, and based on user preferences or the browsing environment, the user agent can choose to ignore this hint.

```html
<video
  src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4"
  controls
  preload="metadata"
  autoplay
></video>
```

### `loop`

The name says it all ðŸ˜€ This is a boolean attribute and so, if present, it indicates that the media content should be played on a loop. In days of old, think [myspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace), it as not uncommon to be greeting by some background music automatically playing and looping in the background while you browsed the users page. This is very uncommon these days and is definitely not a recommended practice.

```html
<video src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
```

[See the live example on Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/schalkneethling/pen/VwpWgpm)

### `muted`

Another self explanatory attribute. This is another boolean attribute that, when present, will set the initial state of the audio track for the media element to muted.

```html
<audio
  src="../assets/morning-birds-singing.mp3"
  controls
  autoplay
  muted
></audio>
```

Note that this only sets the _initial_ state of the audio track and does not have a dynamic effect. In other words, adding this attribute to an `audio` element(using JavaScript as shown below) for example, will not mute the audio.

```javascript
const audio = document.getElementById("birds");
const muteButton = document.getElementById("mute");
muteButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  audio.setAttribute("muted", "true");
});
```

The above then covers the attributes which are common between the `audio` and `video` elements. Before we move onto those attribute unique to the `video` element, there is one additional topic to address.

While the [`audio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#browser_compatibility) and [`video`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#browser_compatibility) element has wide support across browsers, it is still a good idea to provide fallback content for those browser that do not support the element. For example:

```html
<video src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4" controls preload="metadata">
  <p>
    Your browser does not support the video element. You can
    <a href="../assets/villa-pool.mp4">download the video file here</a>.
  </p>
</video>
```

[See the live video example on Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/schalkneethling/pen/mdWWNXW)
[See the live audio example on Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/schalkneethling/pen/ZEeegrP)

Onto the unique attributes of the `video` element.

### `poster`

The `poster` attribute provides a means for the author of the content to specify an image to be used as the first frame of the video before it is played. Technically this can be pretty much anything but, you are encouraged however to provide something that gives the viewer an idea of what to expect when playing the video. You can essentially think of this like the video thumbnails on Youtube.

```html
<video
  src="../assets/villa-pool.mp4"
  controls
  preload="metadata"
  poster="../assets/poster.png"
>
  <p>
    Your browser does not support the video element. You can
    <a href="../assets/villa-pool.mp4">download the video file here</a>.
  </p>
</video>
```
